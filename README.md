App Design
Objective

The objective of this app is to allow users to see what free time they have during the day. It allows user to see how long their free time is and in what time slot they are allowed to create events and other things. It also keeps the user organized in a calendar format.

Audience

The age range for this app would be for everyone. It would be aimed towards users that are busy and want to know when they are free to do other things. It is also aimed towards users that want to become more organized. Their background would be people that have really busy schedules such as students and office workers. User would typically at least put one hour into the app everyday. They would use the app everyday if it is their source of organization.

Experience

As a normal user, I want to be able to see what free time I have during my busy day. I want to know from what time to what time I am going to be free so that I can take a break. I want to be able to maximize my daily work efficiency.

As a heavy user, I want to be able to organize everything from work to school schedule all onto this calendar and see how much free time I have left despite having to study, so that I am able to rest.

Screens

There will be: 4 Screens 1) Calendar Main Screen; displays the amount of free time and the schedule of the day with the view of the calendar 2) Event screen: close up view to the event include the time date location alarm notes 3) Add Event screen: ability to customize the event that the user wants to schedule in their free time or during their day including the time data location alarm notes 4) Setting screen: changes to the setting of the overview of the app including the calendar that the user is using and the alarm sound and the start of the week
